    <h1 style="color:white;">Back End</h1>
    <p style="color:white;border:white;border-style:solid;">Back-end development focuses on what's "under the hood" of
        an application of website, or working on the server-side of things.Back-end developers focus on databases, back-end logic,
         application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. 
        They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.

        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/back-end-developer">(source)</a>Below will be some of the tools 
        you can expect a back-end developer to be using often.

        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>Java is a object-oriented programming language that is used often on the server-side of web applications,a simple explanation of
            what object-oriented means is that everything in the code is an "object" that has a state that can be changed by interacting other with 
            objects.One of the features that make java such a popular language is that its easy to make modular code, as in you can take 
            components of your code and use them with other components.Your typical java code could look something like this
    <pre><code style="color:gray">
        public static void main(String args[]){// this is your "main method"//
            System.out.println("Hello World")//this one line of text will print "Hello World"!//
        }
    </code></pre>

      <div class="tab">
        <h1>Spring</h1>
        <p>Spring is a framework that is used to build web applications using java,you can think of a framework as a "skeleton" to a program
            that comes with features and tools that make it easier to build your program.One of the core features of spring is dependency injection.
            Depency injection is a way for your objects to not have to rely on other objects, making it very easy to test them without worrying about
            affecting objects we don't care about.Spring is a complex framework with many features so further reading is suggested if curious
            about it's workings.

      <div class="tab">
        <h1>MySql</h1>
        <p>Databases are very important and are constantly being worked with in the life of a back-end developer,MySql is an open source tool that
            aids in the management of these  databases.When you are working on only a few pieces of data its a simple task to manage a database with such a size,
            but when you work with millions of pieces of data,software such as MySql become needed to be able to handle such a workload.
